## Long time no see

Yes, it was quite a while since the last post. But we haven't been sleeping, do not worry. In the meantime, some more people have joined the movement. We are now hosting around 80 people.
We are also working hard on ways we can offer a better infrastructure. For that reason, we'll head to Paris in May - for the [OuiShare Labs](http://camp.ouisharelabs.net/2015/).

## OuiShare Awards

We are delighted to tell you that we are nominated for the OuiShare Awards. Here is the video for the pitch:

(It was quickly made over a weekend, faster than the crowdfunding video ;) )

You can support us by voting there: [http://awards.ouishare.net/2015/vote/](http://awards.ouishare.net/2015/vote/).

Please, share, make memes, make fun of us, but spread the word!

## Bonus track

In March we were invited to participate to [FLOSS4P2P](http://www.p2pvalue.eu/floss4p2p-workshop-agenda), a great conference, with excellent speakers. We had a great time, and we even pitched IndieHosters!

You can find the video of the pitch bellow:
